# Python-3-Programming-Specialization  
In this folder, I will upload final assignment in each course for this specialization.  

## Course 1: Python Basics  
**Goal**: To understand sequences and iterations, booleans and conditionals, and sequence mutation and accumulation patterns  
**Final Assignment**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Python_Basics_Final_Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Python_Basics_Final_Assignment.ipynb)  

## Course 2: Python Functions, Files and Dictionaries  
**Goal**: To understand reading/writing files and csv, dictionaries and dictionary accumulation, functions and tuples, more iteration and advanced function, and sorting.  
**Final Assignment**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Functions_Files_Dictionaries_Final_Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Functions_Files_Dictionaries_Final_Assignment.ipynb)  

## Course 3: Data Collection and Processing with Python  
**Goal**: To understand nested data and nested iteration, map-filter and list comprehension, and Internet APIs.  
**Final Assignment**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Data_Collection_and_Processing_Final.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Data_Collection_and_Processing_Final.ipynb)  

## Course 4: Python Classes and Inheritance  
**Goal**: To understand classes, inheritances and unit testing and exceptions.  
**Final Assignment**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Classes_Inheritance_Final_Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Classes_Inheritance_Final_Assignment.ipynb)  

## Course 5: Python Project: pillow, tesseract, and opencv  
**Goal**: To apply first four courses into real-world python implementation. This includes reading documentation, figuring out which functions to use, and using multiple libraries to solve complex problems.  
**Assignment 1: Using Pillow**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/PY3_Capstone_assignment_1.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/PY3_Capstone_assignment_1.ipynb)  
**Assignment 2: Final Project**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Final_capstone_project%20(1).ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/Final_capstone_project%20(1).ipynb)  
**Supplementary files: notebook for three modules in the capstone**  
**Module 1**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/python3_capstone_module_1.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/python3_capstone_module_1.ipynb)  
**Module 2**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/python3_capstone_module_2.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/python3_capstone_module_2.ipynb)  
**Module 3**: [https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/python3_capstone_module_3.ipynb](https://github.com/GoodDee/Python-3-Programming-Specialization/blob/main/python3_capstone_module_3.ipynb)
